# Who We Are
At Nodnin Studios, we're dedicated to fostering creativity, growth, and opportunity within our part of the game industry.

Our mission is to provide a collaborative remote platform where aspiring game developers can thrive, unleash their creativity, and build their careers.

We empower our teams by offering a discord space for game jams and project development, where they can contribute their skills and passion without immediate financial compensation and instead through our unique business model, team members can become independent contractors.

We are committed to transparency and fairness, ensuring that everyone's contributions are valued and compensated. Our royalty-based payment system ensures that every hour invested is recognized and rewarded, with a clear pathway to compensation once games are published and profitable.

While we operate under a non-traditional model, our goal remains clear: to create successful games that not only benefit our studio but also propel the careers of our team members. This drives us to continually refine our production methods and support one another's growth while working together.

Join us at Nodnin Studios for an immersive experience where your role isn't just a jobâ€”it's an integral part of our collective journey towards success.
